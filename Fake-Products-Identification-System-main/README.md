ABSTRACT:

To ensure the identification of real products throughout the supply chain, a functional block 
basic framework ensures that the data content is genuine. So, the proposed system may be 
used to store product details and unique code of that product as blocks in database. It 
collects the unique code from the customer and compares the code against entries in 
database. If the code matches, it will give notification to the customer by using this software, 
consumers do not need to rely on the untrusted third parties to know the source of the 
purchased product safely.

INTRODUCTION / APPROACH

There are so many products that exist in the supply chain. To ensure that the product is real 
or fake. Because of counterfeit or fake products manufacturers facing the biggest problem 
and huge losses. 
The approach will be based on storing the predefined dataset of the products along with their 
unique code. Every new code will get updated in the database. The product’s code will be 
scanned though the application and will be converted into the code. And this code will be 
compared with the values from the database and will be checking if the value gets matched 
with any of the predefined code in the database. For this MySQL will be used for the 
database operations.
We plan to conduct a few surveys within this time for better user input.

Technologies used:
JavaFX, MySQL, Xampp, MySQL-java connector, Window-Builder(Eclipse).

CONCLUSION 

This proposed system is useful for the customer to detect fake products in the supply chain.
Customers can scan QR codes assigned to a product and can get all the information like 
transaction history, current owner based on which end-user can check whether the product 
is genuine or not.
The proposed framework is helpful for the client to recognize counterfeit items in the store 
network. Clients can filter QR codes allotted to an item and can get all the data like 
exchange history, current proprietor dependent on which end-client can check if the item is 
veritable.
